. What is an Application Load Balancer (ALB)?

Operates at OSI Layer 7 (Application layer)

Acts as a single entry point for client requests

Distributes traffic across multiple AZs

Requires at least 2 Availability Zones

Ideal for:

Web applications

Microservices

Containers (ECS / EKS)

APIs

4. Core ALB Components
A. Listener

Listens on a protocol + port (HTTP/80, HTTPS/443)

Evaluates rules in priority order

B. Rules (ALB-ONLY FEATURE)

Each rule has:

Priority

Conditions

Actions

Conditions can be based on:

Path (/video, /web)

Hostname (api.example.com)

Headers

Each listener must have a default rule

📌 Only ALB supports rules

C. Target Groups

Logical group of targets:

EC2

IPs

Containers

Lambda

Health checks are per target group

Targets can belong to multiple target groups

5. How ALB Routing Works

Client sends request

ALB listener receives request

Rules evaluated (priority order)

Matching rule forwards traffic

Target selected from target group

Target processes request

Response returned to client

6. Routing Algorithms

Round-Robin (default)

Least Outstanding Requests

Routes to target with fewest active requests

7. Path-Based Routing (VERY IMPORTANT)

Example:

/video → Video Target Group

/web → Web Target Group

Used heavily in:

Microservices

API routing

Multi-application ALB setups

8. Session Management (Exam Favorite)
Option 1: Sticky Sessions (Cookies)

Client stays bound to same target

Risk: session lost if instance fails

Option 2: ElastiCache (Recommended)

Session data stored in Redis

ALB can route to any instance

More resilient architecture

Exam prefers ElastiCache over sticky sessions

📌 Exam Tip:
If question mentions high availability + sessions → ElastiCache

9. ALB Integrations (EXAM SCENARIOS)
A. Route 53

Used for failover routing

Active-Passive architectures

B. CloudFront

ALB can be a CloudFront origin

Improves global performance

C. AWS Global Accelerator

Provides static IPs

Routes traffic over AWS global network

Improves performance for global users

ALB can be an endpoint

📌 Exam hint:
Global users + low latency → Global Accelerator + ALB

D. ECS / Fargate

ALB commonly used with:

ECS services

Fargate tasks

Dynamic target registration supported

10. When to Choose ALB vs NLB (Exam Classic)
Requirement	Choose
HTTP / HTTPS	ALB
Path-based routing	ALB
Microservices	ALB
Static IP	NLB
UDP	NLB
Millions of TPS	NLB
