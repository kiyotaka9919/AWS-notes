1️⃣ Monitoring Gateway Load Balancer
🔹 CloudWatch Integration

Elastic Load Balancing publishes metrics to Amazon CloudWatch

Metrics are available for:

Gateway Load Balancer

Registered targets (virtual appliances)

Metrics are stored as time-series data

Each metric has:

Timestamp

Optional unit

📌 Exam Point:
CloudWatch is the primary monitoring service for GWLB.

2️⃣ When Are Metrics Published?

Metrics are published ONLY when traffic is flowing

Metrics interval: every 60 seconds

❌ If no traffic, no metrics are reported

📌 This is commonly tested in exam scenarios.

3️⃣ Important GWLB CloudWatch Metrics (VERY IMPORTANT)
✅ ActiveFlowCount

Total number of concurrent active flows

Indicates current traffic load

✅ NewFlowCount

Number of new connections/flows created in a time period

✅ HealthyHostCount

Number of healthy virtual appliance targets

✅ UnHealthyHostCount

Number of unhealthy targets

Helps detect appliance failures

✅ ProcessedBytes

Total bytes processed by GWLB

Includes:

Incoming traffic

Outgoing traffic

❌ Does NOT include health check traffic

✅ ConsumedLCUs

Number of Load Balancer Capacity Units (LCUs) used

Directly impacts billing

4️⃣ What Is a Gateway Load Balancer Capacity Unit (GLCU)?

GLCU is used to measure capacity usage

Based on:

New flows per second

Active flows

Processed bytes

Example (Exam Style)

100 new connections/sec

Each lasting 4 minutes

≈ 24,000 active connections

≈ 0.4 GLCU

5️⃣ GWLB Pricing Model (High-Level)
💰 You Pay For:

GWLB running hours

GLCU usage per hour

📌 Pricing varies by region.

🔹 Example (Mumbai Region – Illustration)

~$0.01 per GWLB hour

~$0 per GLCU hour (example only)

Always check AWS pricing page for exact rates

6️⃣ Free Tier

750 GWLB hours per month

Applies under AWS Free Tier

GLCU usage may still apply beyond limits

7️⃣ Cost Optimization Tips (Exam Perspective)

Reduce:

Unnecessary traffic

Idle appliances

Use:

Auto Scaling Groups

Health checks

Monitor:

ActiveFlowCount

ConsumedLCUs

8️⃣ One-Line Exam Summary

Gateway Load Balancer monitoring is done using CloudWatch metrics published every 60 seconds only when traffic flows, and pricing is based on running hours and GLCU consumption.
