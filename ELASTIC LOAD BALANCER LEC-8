What is Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)?

AWS service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets:

EC2 instances

Containers

IP addresses

Lambda (ALB only)

Improves:

Availability

Scalability

Performance

Fully managed, scalable, and highly available

Supports SSL/TLS encryption

2. How ELB Works

Client sends request

Request reaches ELB (single entry point)

ELB checks target health

ELB forwards request to a healthy target

Target processes request

Response returned to client via ELB

📌 Unhealthy targets are automatically removed

3. Benefits of ELB

High Availability – no single point of failure

Better Performance – routes traffic efficiently

Scalability – auto scales with traffic

Cost Optimization – avoids over-provisioning

Simplified Management – centralized traffic control

4. Types of AWS Load Balancers (VERY IMPORTANT)

AWS provides 4 types of load balancers:

🔹 A. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
Key Points

Legacy load balancer

Operates at Layer 4 (TCP) and Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)

Simple load balancing

❌ No advanced routing

❌ No weighted target groups

📌 Exam Tip:
👉 Not recommended for new architectures

🔹 B. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
Layer

Layer 4 (Transport layer)

Protocols

TCP

UDP

TLS

Key Features

Ultra-low latency

High throughput

Handles millions of requests per second

Preserves client source IP

Supports static IP / Elastic IP

Use Cases

Real-time applications

Gaming

Financial systems

High-performance networking

🔹 C. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Layer

Layer 7 (Application layer)

Protocols

HTTP

HTTPS

Key Features

Content-based routing

Path-based routing (/api, /images)

Host-based routing (app.example.com)

Header-based routing

Session stickiness

Supports Lambda targets

Ideal for microservices

Unique Feature

✅ Rules (only ALB has rules)

Use Cases

Web applications

Microservices

Containers

REST APIs

🔹 D. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
Layer

Layer 3 (Network layer)

Purpose

Load balancing third-party virtual appliances

Examples

Firewalls

IDS / IPS

Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)

Security monitoring tools

Key Components

Gateway Load Balancer

Target Groups

Listeners

Virtual Appliances

Endpoints

📌 Exam Tip:
👉 Used for security & traffic inspection, not web apps

6. One-Line Exam Summary

ALB → Web apps & microservices (Layer 7)

NLB → Ultra-fast, low-latency traffic (Layer 4)

GWLB → Firewalls & security appliances (Layer 3)

CLB → Legacy, avoid in exam answers
