1. What is Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)?

AWS-managed load balancer designed to deploy and scale third-party virtual appliances

Used mainly for network traffic inspection

Operates at OSI Layer 3 (Network layer)

Works as a transparent network gateway

No changes required to application architecture

Virtual Appliances Examples

Firewalls

IDS / IPS

Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)

Network monitoring tools

📌 Exam Trigger:
If the question mentions firewall, IDS/IPS, DPI, security inspection, virtual appliances → GWLB

2. Key Characteristics

Uses GENEVE protocol

Port: UDP 6081

Traffic flows privately over AWS network

Uses Gateway Load Balancer Endpoints

Powered by AWS PrivateLink

Traffic is never exposed to the internet

3. How Gateway Load Balancer Works (High Level)
Normal ALB / NLB Flow

Client → Load Balancer → Application

GWLB Flow

Client → GWLB Endpoint → GWLB → Security Appliance
→ GWLB → Application
(or traffic dropped if rejected)

📌 All traffic is inspected BEFORE reaching applications

4. GWLB Architecture (Exam Favorite)
Service Provider VPC

Hosts:

Gateway Load Balancer

Security appliance EC2 instances

Appliances registered in GWLB target group

Service Consumer VPC

Hosts:

Application servers

GWLB Endpoint

Route tables force all ingress & egress traffic through GWLB

5. Traffic Flow (Step-by-Step)
Ingress (Internet → App)

Traffic enters via Internet Gateway

Route table sends traffic to GWLB Endpoint

Traffic forwarded to GWLB

GWLB sends traffic to security appliance

Appliance:

Allows → traffic forwarded

Denies → traffic dropped

Allowed traffic reaches application server

Egress (App → Internet)

App sends traffic

Route table sends traffic to GWLB Endpoint

Inspected by appliance

Forwarded to Internet Gateway

6. Important Prerequisites

At least two subnets per AZ in consumer VPC:

One for application servers

One for GWLB endpoint

GWLB and appliance targets:

Can be in same subnet

Security appliance instances:

Must allow UDP 6081

Subnets cannot be shared from another account

7. Key Features
✅ Auto Scaling

Works with Auto Scaling Groups

Scales appliances automatically based on traffic

✅ High Availability

Routes only to healthy appliances

Failed appliances automatically bypassed

✅ Marketplace Integration

Easily deploy appliances from AWS Marketplace

✅ Private Connectivity

Uses PrivateLink

Secure, private, no internet exposure

8. Common GWLB Use Cases (EXAM HEAVY)
🔐 Centralized Security

One appliance fleet

Used across:

Multiple VPCs

Multiple AWS accounts

🛡️ Defense-in-Depth

Add third-party firewalls

IDS / IPS

Advanced inspection

📊 Traffic Monitoring & Analytics

Logging

Compliance

Visibility

⚙️ Infrastructure Simplification

Replaces multiple routing + load balancing layers

Cleaner CloudFormation templates

9. When to Choose GWLB (Exam Rule)

Choose Gateway Load Balancer when:

You must inspect all network traffic

You use third-party security appliances

You need transparent inline traffic inspection

You want centralized security across VPCs

10. One-Line Exam Summary

Gateway Load Balancer is a Layer-3 load balancer used to transparently deploy, scale, and manage third-party network security appliances using PrivateLink and GENEVE.
