What is EC2 Instance Store?

Ephemeral (temporary) block-level storage

Physically attached to the EC2 host machine

Data is lost when:

Instance is stopped

Instance is terminated

Host hardware fails

📌 Key Contrast (EXAM FAVORITE):

EBS → Persistent storage

Instance Store → Ephemeral storage

2. Why Use Instance Store?
Performance

Very low latency

Very high IOPS / throughput

Faster than EBS for temporary data

No network overhead (local storage)

3. Use Cases

Best suited for temporary, non-critical data:

Cache

Buffers

Scratch space

Temporary files

Intermediate computation results

⚠️ Applications must be able to regenerate data.

4. Important Characteristics (EXAM POINTS)
Feature	Instance Store
Storage Type	Block
Persistence	❌ No
Lifecycle	Tied to EC2 instance
Performance	Very high
Resize	❌ Not possible
Backup	❌ No snapshots
Boot Volume	❌ Not recommended
Availability	Not on all instance types
5. Boot Volume Limitation

Instance Store is NOT used as a boot volume

Booting from instance store would be slow and unreliable

EC2 instances typically boot from EBS

6. Instance Type Dependency

Not all EC2 instance types support instance store

Capacity and performance:

Fixed at launch

Depends on instance type

Must check:

Instance specifications

Block device mapping at launch

7. Design Considerations

Never store important or persistent data

Implement:

Backup strategies

Data regeneration mechanisms

Best paired with:

EBS

S3

DynamoDB

8. Summary (1-Line Exam Tip)

EC2 Instance Store = high-performance, temporary, local block storage that is lost when the instance stops or terminates.
