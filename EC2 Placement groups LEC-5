1. What are EC2 Placement Groups?

Placement groups control how EC2 instances are placed on underlying hardware

Used to:

Reduce latency

Increase network throughput

Reduce correlated hardware failures

Free of cost

Used mainly for performance-sensitive workloads

2. Default EC2 Placement (Without Placement Group)

EC2 automatically spreads instances across hardware

Minimizes correlated failures

No control over instance proximity

3. Types of Placement Groups

AWS supports three placement strategies:

Cluster

Partition

Spread

🔹 A. Cluster Placement Group
Definition

Logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone

Instances placed close together on the network

Key Characteristics

Very low latency

Very high throughput

High packets per second

Uses high-bisection bandwidth network

Important Exam Points

Single AZ only

Supports enhanced networking

Best when:

Majority of traffic is between instances

Recommended to use same instance type

Performance Limit

10 Gbps per single flow (cluster)

5 Gbps per single flow (non-cluster)

Use Cases

High-performance computing (HPC)

Big data analytics

Machine learning training

Distributed computing

🔹 B. Partition Placement Group
Definition

Instances divided into logical partitions

Each partition runs on separate racks

No two partitions share the same racks

Key Characteristics

Limits impact of hardware failure

Each partition has:

Independent power

Independent networking

Important Exam Points

Can span multiple AZs in the same region

Max 7 partitions per AZ

Visibility into partitions (topology aware)

Supports launching instances into a specific partition

Use Cases

Large distributed systems:

HDFS

HBase

Cassandra

Fault-tolerant replicated workloads

🔹 C. Spread Placement Group
Definition

Each instance placed on distinct hardware

Maximum separation between instances

Key Characteristics

Minimizes risk of simultaneous failures

Best for small number of critical instances

Types

Rack-level spread

Max 7 instances per AZ per group

Can span multiple AZs

Host-level spread

Only available with AWS Outposts

No instance limit

Use Cases

Critical applications

Domain controllers

Small but highly available workloads

4. Placement Group Rules & Limitations (EXAM FAVORITES)

Max 500 placement groups per region per account

Placement group name must be unique per region

❌ Cannot merge placement groups

❌ Instance can belong to only one placement group

❌ Spread groups not supported for Dedicated Instances

Capacity Reservations:

❌ Do NOT reserve capacity for spread or partition groups

If instance is stopped and restarted:

Still belongs to placement group

Start may fail if capacity unavailable

5. Sharing Placement Groups
What is Sharing?

Allows multiple AWS accounts to launch instances into same placement group

Rules

You must own the placement group

Cannot reshare a shared placement group

Requires AWS Organizations enabled

You can only manage your own instances

Cannot view instances owned by other accounts
