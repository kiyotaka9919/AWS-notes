. What is Cross-Zone Load Balancing?

A feature of AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

Distributes incoming traffic evenly across targets in all enabled Availability Zones

Prevents one AZ from becoming a bottleneck

Improves availability, fault tolerance, and performance

2. How Cross-Zone Load Balancing Works

ELB has load balancer nodes in each AZ

With cross-zone enabled:

Each load balancer node can send traffic to targets in all AZs

If one AZ becomes unavailable:

Traffic is automatically routed to healthy instances in other AZs

📌 Exam Concept:
Traffic distribution is balanced across all instances, not just within the same AZ.

3. Without vs With Cross-Zone Load Balancing
Without Cross-Zone

Each AZ handles traffic only for instances in that AZ

Uneven traffic if AZs have different number of instances

With Cross-Zone

Traffic is distributed evenly across all instances in all AZs

Better utilization of instances

4. Benefits of Cross-Zone Load Balancing
✅ Improved Availability

Protects against AZ failure

No single AZ overload

✅ Improved Performance

Even traffic distribution

Reduced latency & better response times

✅ Better Resource Utilization

All EC2 instances receive traffic evenly

Avoids idle instances in low-traffic AZs

5. Limitations / Considerations
⚠️ Increased Cost

You must run:

Load balancer nodes

EC2 instances

In multiple AZs

Cross-AZ data transfer may add cost (exam-relevant nuance)

⚠️ Architecture Complexity

Requires:

Multi-AZ design

Proper health checks

Correct subnet setup

6. Cross-Zone Load Balancing & ELB Types (EXAM FAVORITE)
Load Balancer	Cross-Zone Default
ALB	✔ Enabled by default
NLB	❌ Disabled by default (can be enabled)
CLB	❌ Disabled by default
GWLB	✔ Enabled by default

📌 Exam Tip:
👉 ALB = cross-zone ON by default

7. One-Line Exam Summary

Cross-Zone Load Balancing evenly distributes traffic across all targets in all Availability Zones, improving availability and performance.
