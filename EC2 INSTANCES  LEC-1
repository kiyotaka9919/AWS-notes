1. EC2 Instance Type Naming Convention

Example: c5n.2xlarge

Part	Meaning
c	Instance family → Compute optimized
5	Generation → Gen5 (newer = better HW)
n	Additional attribute → enhanced networking
2xlarge	Size → CPU/RAM ratio
Common Size Labels

nano, micro, small, medium, large

xlarge, 2xlarge, 4xlarge, 8xlarge…
Larger size = more vCPU + RAM.

2. EC2 Instance Families
A. General Purpose (Balanced CPU + RAM + Networking)

Use cases: Web servers, application servers, dev/test, small DBs.
Families: T2/T3/T4g, M5/M6g/M7g, Mac instances.
Key feature: Burstable performance in T families.

B. Compute Optimized (High CPU)

Use cases: Batch processing, HPC, analytics, media transcoding, game servers.
Families: C4, C5, C6g, C7g.
Benefit: High performance processors.

C. Memory Optimized (Large RAM)

Use cases: In-memory DBs, real-time big data, caching, high-performance DBs.
Families: R5, R6g, X1e, z1d, etc.

D. Accelerated Computing (GPU/FPGA)

Use cases: Machine learning training, inference, HPC graphics, simulations.
Families:

P3/P4 → GPU (general ML)

G4/G5 → Graphics inference

F1 → FPGA

VT1 → Video transcoding

E. Storage Optimized (High disk throughput & IOPS)

Use cases: NoSQL DBs, data warehouses, analytics, OLTP.
Families:

I3/I4 → NVMe SSD

D2/D3/D3en → HDD

H1

F. HPC Optimized (High-performance computing)

Use cases: Complex simulations, seismic modeling, genomics.
Families: HPC6id, HPC6a

G. Nitro-Based Instances

AWS-developed hardware platform → improved performance, security, isolation.
Supported by: C5, C5n, M5, R5, T3, T4g, etc.

BENEFITS of Nitro:

Faster I/O

Better network

No virtualization overhead

Dedicated hardware for security

H. ARM-Based (AWS Graviton Processors – Cheap + Fast)

Uses AWS Graviton / Graviton2 / Graviton3.
Families: A1, M6g, C6g, R6g, T4g.
BENEFITS:

Up to 40% better price/performance

Efficient for scale-out applications

Use cases: Microservices, containers, web servers, caching.

3. Why EC2 Instance Families Matter?

Performance optimization

Cost control

Matching resource configuration to workload

Avoid over/under provisioning

Choosing the wrong family = higher cost + low performance.
