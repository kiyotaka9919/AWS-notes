1. Overview: EC2 Network Interface Options

EC2 instances support different Network Interface Card (NIC) options based on performance needs:

Performance order (lowest → highest):

ENI – Elastic Network Interface (basic)

ENA – Elastic Network Adapter (high performance)

EFA – Elastic Fabric Adapter (HPC / ML)

2. Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
What is ENI?

A virtual network card in a VPC

Default & basic networking option for EC2

ENI Capabilities

1 primary private IPv4 address

Multiple secondary private IPv4 addresses

1 Elastic IP per private IPv4

IPv6 addresses

One or more security groups

MAC address

Key Exam Points

Supported on ALL EC2 instance types

No special performance features

Used when no high-performance networking is required

Use Cases

Web servers

Application servers

Database servers

General workloads

3. Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)
What is ENA?

A high-performance network interface

Improves over ENI

Key Features

Uses SR-IOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization)

Provides:

Higher throughput

Higher packets per second (PPS)

Lower latency

Lower CPU utilization

Supports up to 100 Gbps

ENA Implementations

AWS Elastic Network Adapter

Intel 82599 Virtual Function

Key Exam Points

Supported only on specific EC2 instance types (HVM)

Traffic is routable

Best for high bandwidth & low inter-instance latency

Use Cases

High-performance web services

Distributed applications

Latency-sensitive workloads

4. Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
What is EFA?

Specialized network adapter for:

High Performance Computing (HPC)

Machine Learning

Built on top of ENA

Unique Feature: OS Bypass

Allows applications to communicate directly with NIC hardware

Bypasses the instance kernel

Provides ultra-low latency

Modes of Operation
1. OS Bypass Mode

❌ Not routable

❌ Traffic limited to single subnet

✔ Ultra-low latency

2. Normal IP Mode

✔ Routable

✔ Can communicate across subnets

Behaves like ENA

Key Exam Points

Used for tightly coupled applications

Only networking option with OS bypass

Use Cases

HPC clusters

ML training

Scientific simulations

5. ENA vs EFA (EXAM FAVORITE COMPARISON)
Feature	ENA	EFA
Purpose	High-performance networking	HPC / ML
SR-IOV	✔	✔
OS Bypass	❌	✔
Routable traffic	✔	❌ (OS bypass mode)
Subnet restriction	❌	✔ (OS bypass mode)
Typical latency	Low	Ultra-low
6. Quick Decision Guide (Exam-Ready)

Basic networking? → ENI

High bandwidth & low latency? → ENA

HPC / ML / tightly coupled apps? → EFA
