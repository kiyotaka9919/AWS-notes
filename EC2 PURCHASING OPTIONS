Standard RI → best discount

Convertible RI → change instance types within a family

C. Spot Instances

Uses unused EC2 capacity.

Savings: Up to 90%.

Can be interrupted with 2-minute warning.

Best for:

Fault-tolerant, flexible workloads

Batch jobs

Big data

Containers

EC2

Fargate

Lambda

Benefits

High savings

Flexibility across regions, sizes, families (depending on plan type)

Simpler than RIs

Types of Saving Plans
A. Compute Saving Plans

Most flexible

Applies to:

Any EC2 instance, any region, any family

Fargate

Lambda

Equivalent to Convertible RIs but more flexible.

B. EC2 Instance Saving Plans

Applies to specific instance family within a region (e.g., m5).

You can change:

Size (m5.large → m5.xlarge)

OS

Tenancy

Cannot change family (must stay within m5).

C. SageMaker Saving Plans

Save up to 64% on Amazon SageMaker instance usage.

Saving Plan Payment Options

All Upfront

Partial Upfront

No Upfront

Cannot be cancelled or refunded.

3. EC2 Tenancy Models
A. Shared Tenancy (Default)

Multiple customers share physical hardware using virtualization.

Lowest cost.

Suitable for most workloads.

B. Dedicated Tenancy
1. Dedicated Instances

Run on hardware isolated to a single customer.

AWS chooses placement.

Charged per instance + dedicated instance fee.

Good for compliance needs.

2. Dedicated Hosts

Entire physical server allocated to customer.

Customers manage:

Instance placement

Licensing (e.g., BYOL for Oracle, Windows Server)

Best for:

Software license compliance

Visibility of sockets/cores

Full infrastructure control

Key Differences (Exam Focus)
Feature	Dedicated Host	Dedicated Instance
Control of physical server	✔ Full	✖ None
Best for licensing (BYOL)	✔	✖
Pricing	Pay per host	Pay per instance
Visibility of hardware	✔ Yes	✖ No
Important

Tenancy cannot be changed after instance launch.
