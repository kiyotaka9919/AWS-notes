IP Addressing in a VPC

IP addresses enable communication:

Between resources inside the VPC

Between VPC resources and the internet

EC2 uses IPv4 by default

A VPC must be created with an IPv4 CIDR block (e.g., /16)

2. Private IP Address

Assigned to every EC2 instance

Used for internal communication inside the VPC

❌ Not reachable from the internet

Does not change during instance lifetime

📌 EXAM TIP:
Private IPs are used for east-west traffic (instance-to-instance).

3. Public IPv4 Address

Required for internet access

Assigned from AWS public IP pool

✔ Reachable over the internet

❌ Not static

Changes when instance is stopped & started

Released when instance is terminated

Key Exam Facts

Not associated with your AWS account

Cannot manually attach/detach

Controlled by:

Subnet “Auto-assign public IP”

Instance launch settings

4. Elastic IP Address (EIP)
What is an Elastic IP?

Static, persistent public IPv4 address

Allocated to your AWS account

Can be:

Associated

Disassociated

Re-associated to another instance

Why Use Elastic IPs?

High availability & failover

IP does not change

Useful with Route 53

📌 Failover Scenario (EXAM FAVORITE):

EIP moves from failed EC2 → healthy EC2

End users see no outage

Important Elastic IP Rules

When EIP is associated:

Instance’s public IPv4 is released

❌ Cannot convert public IP → Elastic IP

❌ Charged hourly if NOT attached to a running instance

Works only with IPv4

5. IPv4 vs IPv6 (VERY IMPORTANT FOR EXAM)
Feature	IPv4	IPv6
VPC CIDR size	/16 to /28	Fixed /56
Subnet CIDR	/16 to /28	Fixed /64
Public vs Private	✔ Yes	❌ No
NAT required	✔ Yes	❌ No
Elastic IP support	✔ Yes	❌ No
Internet reachable	Public IPv4 only	All IPv6

📌 EXAM GOLD POINT:
👉 All IPv6 addresses are public

6. Internet Connectivity Requirements

To access the internet:

Internet Gateway (IGW) attached to VPC

Route table entry:

0.0.0.0/0 → IGW (IPv4)

::/0 → IGW (IPv6)

Security Group allows traffic

7. Controlling Internet Access

Security Groups

Network ACLs

Route Tables

For IPv6:

Access controlled ONLY via routing + security rules

8. One-Line Summary (EXAM READY)

Private IP = internal, Public IP = temporary internet access, Elastic IP = static public IPv4 for failover & persistence.
