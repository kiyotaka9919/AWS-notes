What is a Network Load Balancer (NLB)?

AWS Elastic Load Balancer that operates at OSI Layer 4 (Transport layer)

Designed for:

Ultra-high performance

Ultra-low latency

Can handle millions of requests per second

Works with:

TCP

TLS

UDP

📌 Exam Trigger:
If the question mentions Layer 4, TCP, UDP, TLS, static IP, or extreme performance → think NLB

2. Key Differences: ALB vs NLB (EXAM CLASSIC)
Feature	ALB	NLB
OSI Layer	Layer 7	Layer 4
Protocols	HTTP / HTTPS	TCP / TLS / UDP
Routing	Path / Host based	IP + Port based
Performance	High	Extremely High
Static IP	❌	✔
Cookies	✔	❌
Source IP preserved	❌	✔
3. How NLB Works (Core Concepts)
Load Balancer Nodes

When you enable an AZ, NLB creates a node in that AZ

Each node routes traffic to targets

Cross-Zone Load Balancing

Disabled by default

❌ Without cross-zone:

Each NLB node sends traffic only to targets in its AZ

✔ With cross-zone enabled:

Each node sends traffic to targets in all AZs

📌 Exam Tip:
NLB + uneven traffic + multi-AZ → Enable cross-zone

4. Traffic Routing Logic
TCP / TLS Traffic

Uses flow hash algorithm based on:

Protocol

Source IP & Port

Destination IP & Port

Supports:

Long-lived TCP connections

WebSocket applications

UDP Traffic

Same flow (same source IP + port) → always routed to the same target

Different UDP flows → can go to different targets

📌 Exam Point:
UDP is connectionless, but NLB still ensures flow consistency

5. TLS with Network Load Balancer

NLB supports TLS listeners

Requires:

At least one server certificate

Can:

Terminate TLS

OR Pass-through encrypted traffic (end-to-end encryption)

📌 Exam Scenario:
If encryption must stay intact until the backend target → NLB

6. Static IP & Elastic IP Support

NLB supports:

Static IP addresses

Elastic IPs (one per subnet)

Configured using subnet mappings

📌 Exam GOLD Rule:
If the question says “static IP required for load balancer” → NLB

7. Common Architecture Scenarios (EXAM FAVORITES)
✅ On-Premises to AWS

Distribute TCP traffic from on-prem servers

Use NLB for predictable IPs

✅ Private SaaS (No Internet)

NLB + VPC Endpoint Service

Traffic stays inside AWS network

✅ Firewall / Whitelisted IPs

NLB with Elastic IP

Firewall allows only known IPs

✅ Cross-VPC / Cross-Account

Secure service-to-service communication

TLS pass-through

8. When to Choose Network Load Balancer

Choose NLB when you need:

TCP / UDP traffic

Static or Elastic IPs

Millions of requests per second

Low latency

Preserve client source IP

TLS pass-through or large-scale TLS termination

9. One-Line Exam Summary

Network Load Balancer is a Layer-4, ultra-fast load balancer that supports TCP, TLS, and UDP with static IPs and source-IP preservation.
